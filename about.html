      <h2>Solving the Healthcare Data Translation Problem</h2>
      <p>Your clinical team needs standardized research data. Your IT department is managing legacy systems. Your business stakeholders want measurable ROI. Everyone speaks a different language, and critical initiatives stall in the translation.</p>
      <p>I specialize in bridging that gap. With 15+ years working across federal agencies, academic medical centers, and life sciences companies, I help healthcare organizations transform fragmented data systems into platforms that support clinical research, real-world evidence, and observational studies.</p>

  <!-- What I Do -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container-narrow">
      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>I don't just implement technology—I facilitate the conversations that make projects succeed. When your OMOP implementation stalls because clinical and IT teams can't agree on priorities, I help find the path forward. When your cloud migration feels overwhelming, I break it into manageable phases. When stakeholders can't see the forest for the trees, I restore project context and drive issues to resolution.</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Areas of Focus:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OMOP Common Data Model Implementation</strong> - Assessment, roadmap development, technical execution, and validation</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud Healthcare Architecture</strong> - Azure, AWS, and Oracle Cloud migration strategy and implementation</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical Research Data Platforms</strong> - Real-world evidence infrastructure and observational study design</li>
          <li><strong>Legacy System Modernization</strong> - Practical approaches to moving aging applications to modern platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Stakeholder Alignment</strong> - Facilitating productive conversations between clinical, IT, and business teams</li>
        </ul>

  <!-- Experience -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container-narrow">
      <h2>Experience That Matters</h2>
      <p><strong>Federal Healthcare:</strong> Consulted with SpinSys on the Defense Health Agency's OMOP implementation—navigating the unique challenges of large-scale federal healthcare data standardization.</p>
      <p><strong>Academic Medical Centers:</strong> Provided strategic guidance for the University of Pennsylvania's Epic OMOP integration, one of the most complex academic medical center implementations in the country.</p>
      <p><strong>Penn Medicine Network:</strong> Spent seven years as Principal Consultant serving Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, and Pennsylvania Hospital—architecting data marts, building operational dashboards, and translating complex clinical metrics into executive insights.</p>
      <p><strong>Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare IT:</strong> Deep experience with EHR systems (Epic, Cerner, Allscripts), claims databases, clinical trial data, and patient registries across pharmaceutical and health IT environments.</p>

<!-- How I Work -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container-narrow">
      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>Successful healthcare data projects need more than technical chops. They require someone who can:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Facilitate real alignment</strong> - Not just nodding heads in meetings, but genuine consensus across clinical, business, and IT priorities</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain context</strong> - When projects span months or years, everyone needs to understand dependencies, trade-offs, and why decisions were made</li>
        <li><strong>Translate fluently</strong> - Converting technical constraints into business language, and business requirements into implementation plans</li>
        <li><strong>Drive to closure</strong> - Identifying decision points, surfacing the right information, and moving projects forward</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Whether you're implementing OMOP for the first time, migrating to cloud platforms, or building research capabilities, I bring experience from federal agencies, academic medical centers, and commercial healthcare—with the scars and lessons that come from actually doing this work, not just talking about it.</p>
